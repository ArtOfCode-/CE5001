The question is: where does Prolog actually apply an *interpretation* of it as an operator. That happens in the body of a predicate, or at the command line. So you can say, `?- eats(Person, baked) ; eats(Person, fried).` and this will show you all `Person` values where that person eats baked or that person eats fried. But if you write `eats(baked ; fried)`, Prolog does *not* interpret `;`. It's just a functor, and it sees this as `eats(';'(baked, fried))`. This may seem odd, but it allows you to write predicates to reason about `;`.","","2","2018-02-12 08:06:47","2018-02-12 21:03:11","41671","1121"

To be honest: no, I didn't consider `zipWithIndex`, because I was entirely focused on the task of writing it in the most awkward way using the mutable counter from OP's non-compiling code. If it was a piece of code that I write for myself, I'd probably use `zipWithIndex` without thinking about it. But yeah... We should of course try to promote best practices here, not mutable counters. ;) Thanks!","","2","2018-02-18 19:34:11","2018-02-18 21:58:35","18614","18614"

The general problem of this approach is that the front-end is not needed for the actual operation that happens in the backend object, hence, the front-end can get collected while an operation is ongoing.

Don't forget that processing time isn't simulated by VEINS automatically -- if you do expensive computations in vehicles, the computation will be considered as instant in simulation time. That's not an issue for most applications (since adding better hardware is not really hard), but keep this in mind if you're looking at time-critical uses of machine learning.","","2","2018-02-15 09:14:21","2018-02-15 16:09:35","732","732"

I personally find it dangerous to practice using loops - reading and processing one row at a time from a base table - in a PL/SQL block, instead of doing set-level processing in SQL.

it is in 2 or 4 character years.  Not exactly sure why it causes concurrent mod exception.  The solution for
me:

That is not what I have asked for (it's not a duplicate for: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/255202/how-do-i-view-git-diff-output-with-my-preferred-diff-tool-viewer).

Im aware that you can choose another diff tool when comparing in git,
the question is where can I find such tool.

I would like to see side by side the diffrences between the message flows / mapping nodes that has changed (IIB development) as it should be displayed, and not in a textual way.

Thanks for the reply. My Objective is integrating RInside with Veins.  For results analysis i use ""omnetpp"" R Package.

(A) 
Using the nested loop means the code is only looking for nested arrays which is why if I use a single loop on this array everything is logged from the outer array level as expected [1,2] [3,4] [5,6] 7 8.
(B) 
It works with the strings because they are ""iterable"" and the length property can be applied to them (i.e they can be indexed).","Nested for loops and multidimensional arrays","1","2018-02-24 00:47:26","2018-02-24 03:17:54","26","26"
